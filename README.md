## SpaceYaTech Laravel

The SpaceYaTech Content Management system is an open-application that lets users to quickly publish content and share it with ease to their audience. Inspired by existing CMSes like Hashnode, Wordpress, DEV and Joomla, we felt the need to create an African CMS created by young Africans looking to learn by contributing to Open Source. SpaceYaTech opted for a CMS as the debut open source project because of the technicalities involved in creating, maintaining and scaling a CMS. A CMS poses great technical challenges and a great learning opportunity for those looking to grow their tech skills.

The first edition of the CMS, should at the bare minimum:

- Let Users create accounts using their email addresses.
- Let Users sign-in to their accounts using their email addresses or third-party auth services.
- Let Users customize their profiles/accounts i.e Change avatars and bio-data.
- Let Users create and persist content containing different media.
- Let Users delete content they don't want to appear on their accounts.
- Let Users post comments on posts they find useful.
- Let Users react to posts and comments that they find useful.
- Let Users own a subdomain prefixed by their username e.g username.spaceyatech.com

There is a nice project [wiki](https://github.com/SpaceyaTech/CMS-Backend-Repository/wiki/Technical-Description-Of-Product) that describes the technical aspects of the Open-Source CMS we're trying to build.
